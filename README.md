# Hovercraft

This is a Raspberry Pi Pico based project: a hovercraft capable of moving, steering and obstacle avoidance by use of an ultrasonic sensor and opening/closing shutters connected to its pressurized interior.

All the 3D printed parts from this project are available in the models folder.

PlatformIO is needed to build project "Robot Control Program".

A detailed/exploded view of the complete assembly is in the works..

Made as part of the Robotics Engineering Project course at the University of Tartu.
